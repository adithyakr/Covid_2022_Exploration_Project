# Covid_2022_Exploration_Project

The pandemic has changed the course of life in the last two years. But, at the same time, this has helped students like me gets our hands dirty to explore millions of records of data. The covid exploration project has helped me identify striking/hidden patterns and derive insights that can help identify correlation between the spread of the virus and various geophraphical and biological factors. 

The project is split into two different parts

1. Data exploration and cleaning using MSSQL
2. Data Visualalization using Tableau

Covid case, death and vaccination data until 01-10-2022 is fetched and analyzed to derive insights.
